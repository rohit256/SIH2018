### Current Scenario

The mail operations right from booking to delivery works in an offline mode. The nodes communicate with the central server through a client for exchange of data.
</br>
Also in rural areas internet connectivity is very low due to which people are not able to track their consignment. Moreover, at the post-office the internet connectivity fluctuates very frequently due to which offline maintenance of data is mandatory.
</br>
### Implemented Solution

A comprehensive framework to integrate the entire mail operations  right from booking to delivery into an online  system which can handle connectivity disturbances: 
</br>
-> A web application and an android mobile application enabling the customers to get the status of their consignment.→→
</br>
-> A USSD application enabling the customers to track their consignment in case of no internet connection.→→
</br>
-> A desktop application for managing and administrating the various operations in the post-office which works in an offline mode.→→
</br>
-> A web application for various  post office server operations where there is no internet fluctuation.→→
